**Objective**: The objective of this project is to use the Netflix dataset to develop a machine learning model that can accurately predict the likelihood that a user will give a rating of 5 to the movie "Love Actually" based on their preferences for the 30 other movies.

**Method**: 
1. Preprocess the Netflix dataset by cleaning and normalizing the data. 
2. Split the dataset into training and test sets. 
3. Train a machine learning model on the training dataset using an appropriate algorithm. 
4. Test the model on the test dataset and calculate the accuracy. 
5. Evaluate the model and make any necessary improvements. 

**Results:** The results of this project will be the accuracy of the model in predicting whether a user will give a rating of 5 to the movie "Love Actually" based on their preferences for the 30 other movies.
